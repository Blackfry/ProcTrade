<h1>ProcTrade</h1>

ProcTrader is primarily a vehicle for my learning JavaScript. The tech used is listed below. It is currently fetching data from OANDA's
sandbox api (primarily currencies) and I will be attempting to pair that data with chartiq.com charting library.

My intentions for the project are: 
<ul>
  <li> To experiment with learnings as I encounter them. Specifically looking at JavaScript, Reactjs, flux (Reflux), webpack, react-router, nodejs/express.</li>
  <li> To build a financial data charting interface with implications for trader education.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Status</h2>

This is a work in progress.
